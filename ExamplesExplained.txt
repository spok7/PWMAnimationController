PWM Animation Library

This library was made to help create servo animations quickly and easily. It does so through passing object pointers through the hierarchy of object displayed below.

How to use:

1. Declare a pointer to a non initialized LNInterface object (controller) as a class variable
	this will manage all LocoNet and button interactions
2. In the setup method, declare a pointer to an initialized Adafruit_PWMServoDriver object
3. Run the begin() and setPWMFreq(60) methods
	60 is default for analog servos
4. Create pointers to different PWM handlers
5. Create animation chains
	a. Pass in handlers to the addPWM method, along with position and speed parameters
	b. Add pin events
	c. Add delays
6. Add animations to chains to make them run in series, or add animations to nodes to make them run in parallel
7. Initialize the LNInterface controller
8. Map the animations to the desired decoder funcitons
9. Map buttons (pin inputs) to derised decoder functions as necessary
10. Run the update function in main loop


SimpleServo.ino explained
-	The controller pointer is set as a class variable to be accessible from the setup and the loop.
-	The servo driver is set as usual (though it is a pointer), to the first I2C address, and set to update on a 60Hz interval (default for analog servos).
-	A ServoHandler object is declared on pin one, with no offset, and with the driver declared above.
-	A new AnimationChain is created to store a simple servo animation
